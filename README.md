# Resume
A repository of the code I have access to that I have created or worked on with sensitive details being removed.

#Powershell
Code I created and worked on that runs alongside the SIS school systems to automatically create Staff and Student Accounts. Task scheduler allows it to run daily at a specified time.
-Staff allows both to run from a shared google sheet and from user input so it is centralized and those unfamiliar with Active Directory can easily add users.

#Website
Job listings page of a website that I worked on.
Figma link of end product idea (mobile version) which I worked on alongside the graphic design department: https://www.figma.com/proto/YIHkn8jFUFAyD3v9sq1bWt/Log-in-Page-Prototype?node-id=51-26&starting-point-node-id=51%3A26&mode=design
