# Resume
A repository of the code I have access to that I have created or worked on with sensitive details being removed
#Powershell
Code I created and worked on that runs alongside the SIS school systems to automatically create Staff and Student Accounts. Task scheduler allows it to run daily at a specified time.
/Staff allows both to run from a shared google sheet and from user input so it is centralized and those unfamiliar with Active Directory can easily add users
#Website
Job listings page of a website that I worked on
